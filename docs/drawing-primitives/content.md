As graphics generation is very simillar to contructor assebmly where you have to build something complex and beautiful from very basic and simple parts current version of library supports following primitives:

:::caution
All primitives are almost equal in speed terms, but currently due to certain problems in shaders implementation library allows only **~2000** to be rendered at comparably normal speed.
:::

- [Point](point-primitive)

- [Line](line-primitive)

- [Circle](circle-primitive)

- [Sphere](sphere-primitive)

Additional:

- [3 Indeced Polygon (Triangle)](poly-primitive)

- [Tetrahedron (Triangle Pyramid)](pyramid-primitive)
