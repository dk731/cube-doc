As graphics generation is very similar to constructor assembly, where you have to build something complex and beautiful from fundamental and simple parts current version of the library supports the following primitives:

:::caution
All primitives are almost equal in speed terms, but currently, specific problems in the shaders implementation library allow only **~2000** to be rendered at comparably average speed.
:::

- [Point](point-primitive)

- [Line](line-primitive)

- [Circle](circle-primitive)

- [Sphere](sphere-primitive)

Additional:

- [Polygon With 3 Indices (Triangle)](poly-primitive)

- [Tetrahedron (Triangle Pyramid)](pyramid-primitive)

:::tip
Additional examples can be found on a project [Github Page](https://github.com/dk731/3D-Led-Cube/) in the `examples` directory
