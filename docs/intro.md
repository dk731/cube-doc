# Introduction

Displays and graphics are facinating field of software and hardware, that gives easy and intuitive way to visualize data and art, but what if we add another dimension and have a 3D display?

**TryCubic** project is here to discover this phenomena and give apportunity to anyone who is interested to play with this techonology. Code can be submited through [trycubic.com](https://trycubic.com/), follow us on [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/trycubicnow). More info about code submition can be found [here](/code-sub/code_sub)

Only authorized user can submit their and like other jobs, **NO PRIVATE INFORMATION ABOUT USER IS STORED OR SHARED**. Only scrambled user names from _google_ or _github_ are used for inditification.

## About The Project

This project is an implementation of a unique device and tools to program it. Hardware part consists of actual display (3D grid of small 3 colored LED's) and Raspberry PI board to controll it, special design allows end user to controll each voxel independently from the others and does not produce any flickering achiving ~110 frames per second. More about implementation can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/dk731/3D-Led-Cube).

## What Is This?

This is a documentation for Python library that allows you to programm 3D display with easy and powerful interface. Curretly supported Python version are >=3.6 & <= 3.10.

# How This Works?

If you willing to try out and run your code on this device, special tools were developed to help you. Following steps should be made to achive this:

1. Write your code

<br/>

2. Test it using [emulator](https://cube.trycubic.com)

<br/>

3. When result satisfies you, submit your code to the running queue

<br/>

After you ideas has been developed and submited later during live stream you with other viewers will be able to observe your animation in real time and get your own video afterwards.
