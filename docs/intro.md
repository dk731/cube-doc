# Introduction

Displays and graphics are a fascinating field of software and hardware that gives an easy and intuitive way to visualize data and art, but what if we add another dimension and have a 3D display?

**TryCubic** project is here to discover this phenomenon and allow anyone interested to play with this technology. Code can be submitted through [cube.qwe.me](https://cube.qwe.me/), follow us on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/trycubicnow). More info about code submission can be found [here](/code-sub/code_sub)

:::caution
Only authorized users can submit and, like other jobs, **WE ARE NOT STORING OR SHARING ANY PRIVATE INFORMATION**. Only scrambled user names from _google_ or _github_ are used for identification.

## About The Project

This project is an implementation of a unique device and tools to program it. The hardware part consists of an actual display (3D grid of small three colored LED's) and a Raspberry PI board to control it. Exceptional design allows an end-user to control each voxel independently without producing flickering, achieving ~110 frames per second. More about implementation can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/dk731/3D-Led-Cube).

## What Is This?

This is the documentation for the Python library that allows you to program 3D display with an easy and powerful interface. Currently supported Python version are >=3.6 & <= 3.10.

# How This Works?

If you are willing to try out and run your code on this device, we developed special tools to help you. Following steps should be made to achieve this:

1. Write your code

<br/>

2. Test it using [emulator](https://sim.cube.qwe.me/)

<br/>

3. When the result satisfies you, submit your code to the running queue

<br/>

After your ideas have been developed and submitted later during a live stream, you, with other viewers, will be able to observe your animation in real-time and get your video afterward.
