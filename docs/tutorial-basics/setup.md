# Setup

Before getting to our first lines of code, you must install the library. The whole process should take _~5_ min and requires from you only knowledge of using [PIP](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/).

## Requirements

Currently, project-supported platforms are: `Linux` and `Windows` in `32/64` bit versions. If your platform is now listed, you will have to build the project yourself from source files located in [GitHub](https://github.com/dk731/3D-Led-Cube). The system must have GPU with the latest drivers installed for the best experience.

:::caution
In some cases, the library won't work (_library boots and does not throw any error, but no visual output is generated_) as expected with built-in drivers; please use original manufacturer drivers.
:::

## Instalation

1. Install python from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (_Supported versions are: 3.6 - 3.10_)

2. Install `pip` if not installed

3. Using [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) install `LedCD` by excecuting followin command line: `pip install --no-cache-dir LedCD`

#### And that's it if everything went as planned now you are ready to write your first program!
