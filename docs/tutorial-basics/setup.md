## Requirements

Currently project supported platforms are: `Linux` and `Windows` in `32/64` bit versions. If your platform is now listed, you will have to build project yourself from source files that are located in [GitHub](https://github.com/dk731/3D-Led-Cube). Also library requires from your system a GPU with installed drivers that supports OpenGL ES drivers with version >= 3.1.
