# Setup

Before getting to our first lines of code, first we will need to install all needed tools and dependecies.

## Requirements

Currently project supported platforms are: `Linux` and `Windows` in `32/64` bit versions. If your platform is now listed, you will have to build project yourself, all needed information can be found in: `#BUILD_PROJ_SECTION`.

## Instalation

Whole instalation should not take more than 5 minutes:

- First thing to do is install python from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (_Supported versions are: 3.6 - 3.10_)
- Using [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) install `#LIBRARY_NAME` by excecuting followin command line: `pip install --no-cache-dir #LIBRARY_NAME`

#### And thats it if everything went as planed now you are ready to write your first program!
